## üì± Sharing Your Prototype via SMS

While deploying this prototype to the internet with cloud services and Docker is out of scope for this demonstration, you can still share your working prototype with colleagues and end users for valuable feedback using SMS integration.

### Why SMS Integration?

This approach allows you to:
- **Get real user feedback** without complex deployment
- **Test with actual end users** in a familiar medium (text messages)
- **Validate your prototype** before investing in full deployment
- **Gather insights** on user needs and pain points
- **Demonstrate value** to stakeholders with working examples

### Setup Instructions

Follow the detailed instructions in the `twilio/` folder:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask twilio python-dotenv requests
   ```

2. **Set Up Twilio Account:**
   - Sign up for a free Twilio account at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
   - Purchase a phone number (free trial available)
   - Get your Account SID and Auth Token

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `twilio/` directory with your Twilio credentials

4. **Set Up ngrok for Local Development:**
   - Install and authenticate ngrok
   - Use the provided `run_ngrok.sh` script for easy setup

5. **Configure Twilio Webhook:**
   - Point your Twilio phone number's webhook to your ngrok URL + `/webhook`

6. **Run the Application:**
   - Start your Langflow server (port 7860)
   - Start the Twilio webhook server (port 8888)
   - Start ngrok tunnel

### How It Works

1. **User sends SMS** to your Twilio phone number
2. **Twilio webhook** receives the message
3. **API request** is sent to your Langflow flow
4. **RAG system** processes the question using Citizens Advice data
5. **Response** is sent back to the user via SMS

### Example User Interactions

Users can ask questions like:
- "What is Universal Credit?"
- "How do I apply for Housing Benefit?"
- "Am I eligible for Personal Independence Payment?"
- "What benefits are available for disabled people?"

The system will respond with helpful, contextual information from the Citizens Advice knowledge base.

### Benefits for Prototyping

- **Low barrier to entry** - Users just need to send a text message
- **Real-world testing** - Test with actual user scenarios
- **Immediate feedback** - Get responses and reactions quickly
- **Cost-effective** - Minimal setup costs compared to full deployment
- **Scalable feedback** - Easy to share with multiple stakeholders

For complete setup instructions, see the `twilio/README.md` file.

## üéÆ Using the RAG System

### Step 4: Run the Flow

1. **Open the Flow:**
   - Click on the "Citizen Advice RAG" project in your projects list
   - The flow canvas will open showing the complete RAG pipeline

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - The flow includes components for:
     - **URL Component:** Scrapes content from Citizens Advice benefits pages
     - **Text Splitting:** Breaks content into manageable chunks
     - **Embeddings:** Converts text to vector representations using Mistral AI
     - **Chroma Database:** Stores and retrieves relevant information
     - **Mistral Model:** Generates responses based on retrieved context

3. **Start the Playground:**
   - Click on the "Playground" tab in the interface
   - This opens the chat interface where you can interact with the system

### Step 5: Ask Questions

You can now ask questions about UK benefits, such as:

- "What is Universal Credit and how do I apply?"
- "Am I eligible for Housing Benefit?"
- "How does volunteering affect my benefits?"
- "What benefits are available for disabled people?"
- "How do I claim Child Benefit?"
- "What is Personal Independence Payment?"

The system will:
1. Search the Citizens Advice knowledge base
2. Retrieve relevant information
3. Generate contextual, accurate responses
4. Provide source information when available

## üîç Flow Architecture

The RAG system consists of several key components:

```
User Query ‚Üí Chat Input ‚Üí Chroma Search ‚Üí Context Retrieval ‚Üí Prompt Template ‚Üí Mistral Model ‚Üí Response
```

**Key Components:**
- **URL Component:** Scrapes [Citizens Advice benefits pages](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/)
- **SplitText:** Breaks content into semantic chunks for better retrieval
- **Mistral AI Embeddings:** Creates vector representations of text
- **Chroma Database:** Stores embeddings and enables similarity search
- **Prompt Template:** Structures the context and question for the LLM
- **Mistral Model:** Generates human-like responses based on retrieved context

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No module named 'langflow.__main__'" Error:**
   - Use `uv run langflow run` instead of `langflow run`
   - Reinstall with: `uv pip install langflow -U --force-reinstall`

2. **API Key Errors:**
   - Ensure API keys are correctly set in Global Variables
   - Verify keys are valid and have sufficient credits
   - Check for typos in variable names

3. **Chroma Database Issues:**
   - Clear cache if needed: Delete contents of `~/.cache/langflow/`
   - Restart Langflow after clearing cache

4. **Performance Issues:**
   - Ensure you have at least 4GB RAM available
   - Close other resource-intensive applications
   - Consider using Langflow Desktop for better performance
